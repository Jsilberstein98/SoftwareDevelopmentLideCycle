1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Answer: I interpret user needs and implement them into my program through the use of user stories. My initial thought is end usability and how can the user benefit from what I am doing. This is why I believe creating user stories is so helpful. Not only do they contextualize the problems associated with any given project, but they also help to ensure that we as developers are humanizing the item and showing its uses and potential additive effects. Another useful outcome of user stories is that they often help us to identify potential additions to the project that could be beneficial to the end-user.


2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Answer: I approach developinh programs like I would any type of challenge or problem. I would initially identify what it is we are trying to do, and work backwords from there to develkop a timeline and list of milestones to meet that goal, aall the while evolving what the proces looks like to meet the needs of each milestone of progress. Going forward, I hope to incorporate the level of transparency associated with agile, into my future work. It is great to be honest with others, but I find it can often be most difficult to be honest with ones self sometimes, and especially when things get difficult or taxing.


3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Answer: The answer to what a good team member is, will always rely on what the team needs out of its members. In that regard, I believe that it is important to note that there is no one definition of a good team member, other than that they have a good idea of how best to serve the team they are involved with. In software development, my opinion is that to be a good team member is to be flexible, empathetic, responsive, and proactive. The team member in a software develpopment role needs to be self-sufficient to an extent, reliable, and responsible, in terms of the work that is asked of them. Above all else, a good team member in a software development team is flexible and malliable with adjustments and work loads.
